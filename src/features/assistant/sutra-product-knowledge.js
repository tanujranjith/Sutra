// Sutra Product Knowledge Registry — verified, local, offline product facts.
//
// This module is the single source of truth for "what Sutra is and how it
// works." It powers offline product/help answers in Sutra Assistant (the Local
// Intent Router and the Local Help decision tree both read from here) WITHOUT
// any provider call or API key.
//
// Design rules (enforced by tests):
//   - Every entry describes ONLY implemented, reachable functionality.
//   - Each entry declares an `availability`:
//       'available'          — works now, offline, no setup
//       'requires_setup'     — needs a one-time local setup step
//       'requires_provider'  — needs an AI provider + API key (a network call)
//       'not_supported'      — explicitly NOT a thing Sutra does
//   - `nav` (when present) is a CERTIFIED navigation target: a view key the
//     assistant's navigate action understands, plus an optional settings section.
//   - Retrieval is deterministic keyword/title/summary scoring — no embeddings,
//     no network, no telemetry. Adding a feature = one new entry here.
//
// Public surface: window.SutraProductKnowledge (and module.exports for tests).
