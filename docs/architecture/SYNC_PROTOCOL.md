# Sutra Sync Protocol v1

Status: normative. This document is the source of truth for Sutra's incremental,
end-to-end-encrypted multi-device sync ("Sutra Sync"). The machine-readable copy
of the record classification lives in `src/sync/sync-protocol.js`
(`CLASSIFICATION`); a unit test asserts this document's table and the code agree
with `docs/architecture/persistence-inventory.json`.

Sutra Sync is a **separate system from backups**. Encrypted `.sutra` backups,
Sutra Cloud provider backups, and Google Drive snapshot sync are unchanged and
independent recovery mechanisms. Sync replicates *changes*; backups preserve
*moments*.

## 1. Goals / non-goals

Goals:
- Local-first: Sutra stays fully usable with sync disabled; disabled sync makes
  **zero** network requests.
- Changes made on one device appear on others automatically; offline changes
  queue and upload later.
- Record-level three-way merge: independent changes merge automatically;
  concurrent edits to the same record never silently destroy either version.
- The server stores **ciphertext only** plus bounded routing metadata.
- Local persistence remains authoritative while the app runs; sync failures never
  block or corrupt local saving.

Non-goals (v1):
- Real-time character-by-character collaborative editing (no CRDT or OT). Sync
  performs a conservative block-level three-way merge after durable saves.
- Shared/multi-user vaults (one private vault per Supabase auth user).
- Syncing device-local operational state (tokens, caches, scroll positions).

## 2. Identity

- **deviceId** — random UUID generated when sync is enabled on a device; stored
  only in the local sync database. Never appears in workspace exports.
- **lamport** — per-device monotonic counter, incremented for every op the device
  creates. Persisted locally; never decreases.
- **opId** — `"<deviceId>:<lamport>"`. Globally unique, idempotency key.
- **clientTime** — ISO timestamp on each op, **informational only**. Ordering and
  conflict resolution never use wall-clock time (clocks skew and move backward).
- **server cursor** — a server-assigned, monotonically increasing sequence number
  (bigserial). The authoritative pull position. Clients store the last cursor
  they have fully applied.

## 3. Record model

The unit of sync is a **record**, addressed by a record key:

- `c/<collection>/<id>` — one entity in an id-keyed collection.
- `a/<section>` — an atomic section synced as one document.
- `a/<section>.__rest` — the leftover keys of a section whose collections were
  extracted (e.g. `homeworkWorkspace` minus `courses`/`tasks`).
- `o/<name>` — an ordering document (array of ids).

`<id>` segments are encoded with `encodeURIComponent` so `/` in ids cannot forge
keys.

### 3.1 Projection

The **sync projection** is a deterministic flat map `recordKey → value` built
from the dedicated sensitive-stripped sync payload
(`buildWorkspaceExportPayload({mode:'sync',
includeSensitiveSettings:false})`). Sync mode is intentionally distinct from
plaintext JSON recovery: durable Assistant conversations always enter the
encrypted sync payload when chat history is enabled, regardless of the user's
separate plaintext-recovery preference. Determinism rules:

- Values are canonicalized with `stableStringify` (recursively sorted object
  keys; arrays keep their order; `undefined` properties dropped; no NaN/Infinity
  — they serialize as `null` like JSON).
- Each record's **hash** is SHA-256 (hex) of its `stableStringify` form.
- Collection entries missing a usable string `id` fold into the owning section's
  `__rest` record — never dropped, never a crash.
- Unknown/extra fields inside records are preserved verbatim (older clients must
  not strip fields they don't understand).

### 3.2 Classification (v1)

| Workspace field | Class | Record keys |
|---|---|---|
| `pages` | collection | `c/pages/<id>` + `o/pages` |
| `tasks` | collection | `c/tasks/<id>` + `o/tasks` |
| `taskOrder` | ordering | `o/taskOrder` (the field's array value) |
| `timeBlocks` | collection | `c/timeBlocks/<id>` + `o/timeBlocks` |
| `homeworkWorkspace` | collections + rest | `c/homeworkCourses/<id>` + `o/homeworkCourses` (`.courses`), `c/homeworkTasks/<id>` + `o/homeworkTasks` (`.tasks`), `a/homeworkWorkspace.__rest` (schemaVersion, revision, quarantine, …) |
| `reviewWorkspace` | collections + rest | `c/reviewDecks/<id>` + `o/reviewDecks` (`.decks`), `c/reviewItems/<id>` + `o/reviewItems` (`.items`, flat SRS cards with `deckId` refs), `a/reviewWorkspace.__rest` (sessions, settings) |
| `assistantChatHistory` | collections + rest | `c/assistantConversations/<id>` + `o/assistantConversations` (`.conversations`), `a/assistantChatHistory.__rest` (version, currentChatId, legacyMigrationComplete) |
| `customTabs` | collection | `c/customTabs/<id>` + `o/customTabs` |
| `trash` | collection | `c/trash/<id>` + `o/trash` |
| `privateDocuments` | collection | `c/privateDocuments/<id>` + `o/privateDocuments` |
| `syncAuditLog` | collection | `c/syncAuditLog/<id>` + `o/syncAuditLog` |
| `migrationHistory` | collection | `c/migrationHistory/<id>` + `o/migrationHistory` |
| `spaces`, `streaks`, `habitTracker`, `collegeTracker`, `academicWorkspace`, `collegeAppWorkspace`, `lifeWorkspace`, `businessWorkspace`, `apStudyWorkspace`, `courseWorkspace`, `schoolSchedule`, `gradePlanner`, `semesterSetup`, `cramSessions`, `focusSessions`, `focusTemplates`, `testingHub`, `pinnedPages`, `notificationsState`, `energyProfile`, `protectedTime`, `taskDependencies`, `studySessions`, `masteryRecords`, `confidenceObservations`, `studentDecisionState`, `assistantPermissions`, `assistantMemory`, `sharedStudySessions`, `operatingManual`, `portfolioWorkspace`, `settings`, `globalTheme`, `migrationDiagnostics`, `compatibility`, `localStorageSnapshot`, `schema`, `unknownWorkspaceFields` | atomic | `a/<field>` |
| `version` | reconstructed | travels as `schemaVersion` on every op; the receiver writes its supported version |
| `exportedAt` | ephemeral | export timestamp, never canonical sync state |
| `workspaceMeta`, `ui`, `splitPaneContexts` | excluded | device-local save coordination and browser UI state |

`c/pages/<id>` owns every durable page surface. This includes Notepad content,
Canvas state, and the versioned `page.slides` deck (slide order, elements,
speaker notes, and bounded inline local image data). Adding, editing, reordering,
or removing a nested slide produces an upsert for its owning page; deleting the
page produces the normal page-record tombstone. Snapshot and incremental paths
therefore project the same Slides and Canvas state without editor-specific
stores or operations.

Every collection emits an `o/<collection>` ordering doc capturing its array
order (ids in sequence). Collection entries lacking a usable string `id` fold
into an `a/<field>.__rest` record (`{ orphans: [...] }` for top-level arrays)
so nothing is silently dropped.

The generated Help & Docs page (`help_page` / `systemRole: "help-docs"`) is
excluded at record level because every runtime reconstructs it. User-created
pages—including their version history—travel. The exact top-level, nested,
localStorage, asset, secret, compatibility, and ephemeral decisions are
machine-readable in `persistence-inventory.json`; `round-trip-check.mjs`
fails if defaults, serializer/import, inventory, or protocol drift by name.

### 3.2.1 Record field policies

Some fields inside otherwise-synced records are per-device churn and get a
field-level policy (`CLASSIFICATION.recordFieldPolicies`):

- **hashVolatile** — carried in op payloads but excluded from the record
  hash, so a change to only these fields is not a change. `pages.updatedAt`
  is hashVolatile: the app bumps it on every save of the open page; without
  the policy, every device would forever conflict on whatever page is open.
  `assistantChatHistory.__rest.exportedAt` remains hashVolatile for backwards
  compatibility with older baselines; current sync-mode snapshots omit it.
- **localOnly** — never travel (stripped from payloads and hashes); on apply,
  the receiving device keeps its own values.
  `homeworkWorkspace.__rest.revision`, `updatedAt`, and `lastMutation`
  are localOnly bookkeeping. Page `versions` are durable user history and
  are synchronized.

On convergence (local hash == remote hash) the merge keeps the **local**
record value so hash-volatile metadata is not needlessly clobbered.

Additional exclusions stripped from within the `a/settings` record:
- **`settings.preferences.sync`** — the sync-enable flag and endpoint are
  device-local, and must never force-enable sync on another device.
- **`settings.dataHealth`** — mutates on every local save
  (`lastSaveAttemptAt`); syncing it would keep the settings record permanently
  dirty and replicate device-local persistence-health stamps.

On apply, the receiving device re-injects its own current values for all
stripped paths so a remote apply never clobbers device-local state.

Course-file records sync metadata through the workspace projection, but
`_exportBlob`, `dataUrl`, and `missingBlob` are stripped. Actual bytes travel
only through the encrypted content-addressed asset channel. A newly referenced
remote file is marked missing until its bytes decrypt and pass the SHA-256
integrity check.

Inline note images, document backgrounds, and embedded handwriting bytes travel
inside the encrypted page record/snapshot rather than the external asset
channel. Portable local mirrors—Assistant provider/model labels, Assistant
Memory and Activity, custom starter packs, and Homework countdown pins—travel
only through the allowlisted `localStorageSnapshot`; session keys, tokens,
provider configuration, sync state, and regenerable caches never enter it.

Ordering documents merge by stable item identity: concurrent inserts are
unioned, removals converge, and the greater authenticated operation determines
relative order when both sides reorder the same surviving items. Record content
remains separate, so reorder-versus-edit and move-versus-edit preserve both.

## 4. Op record

```
{
  opId:            "<deviceId>:<lamport>",
  deviceId:        string,
  lamport:         number,
  recordKey:       string,
  kind:            "upsert" | "delete",
  baseHash:        string | null,   // hash the edit was based on (null = created)
  hash:            string | null,   // hash of payload (null for delete)
  payload:         object | array | null,  // record value; null for delete
  schemaVersion:   number,          // APP_SCHEMA_VERSION of the writer
  protocolVersion: 1,
  clientTime:      ISO string       // informational only
}
```

Push is idempotent: the server dedupes on `opId` (unique constraint) and a
duplicate push acknowledges without appending.

### 4.1 Versioning policy

- `protocolVersion` bumps on any incompatible change to op/envelope/record-key
  semantics. A client seeing a higher `protocolVersion` than it supports pauses
  sync with an "update Sutra" status; it never guesses.
- `schemaVersion` is the writer's workspace schema. On pull, remote payloads are
  merged and the merged workspace runs through `SutraMigrations.migrateWorkspace`
  before hydration. A client seeing `schemaVersion > APP_SCHEMA_VERSION` pauses
  sync ("update required") rather than writing state it cannot understand —
  mirroring the stale-asset skew guard philosophy.
- Unknown fields in payloads are preserved verbatim, never stripped.

## 5. Encryption

- **Vault master key**: 256 random bits, generated once per vault when sync is
  first enabled. Encrypts everything. Never leaves the client unwrapped.
- **Key wrapping**: the user's sync passphrase derives a wrapping key via
  PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 (600,000 iterations, 16-byte random salt — matching the
  `.sutra` convention); the master key is AES-GCM-wrapped (fresh 12-byte IV,
  AAD `"sutra-sync-vault:v1:<keyId>"`). `keyId` is the SHA-256 fingerprint of
  the vault key: it authenticates the key identity without exposing the key.
  Only the **wrapped** blob + key id + public KDF params are stored (locally,
  and server-side for new-device bootstrap). A first writer may create the
  remote key; later writes use compare-and-swap. A different key id is a hard
  split-brain error and is never overwritten.
- **Op/snapshot envelopes**: AES-GCM-256 under the vault key, fresh 12-byte IV
  per envelope, 128-bit tag. Envelope:

```
{
  v: 1, alg: "A256GCM",
  iv: base64,
  ct: base64,                    // ciphertext of stableStringify(op)
  meta: { opId, deviceId, lamport, recordKey, kind, protocolVersion, schemaVersion }
}
```

  `meta` is the **only** plaintext the server sees, and it is bound as AAD
  (UTF-8 of `stableStringify(meta)`) — a server that reroutes or relabels an
  envelope causes decryption failure. Known metadata leak, accepted in v1: the
  server can see record keys (section names + opaque ids), op counts, sizes, and
  timing. It can never see note content, titles, tasks, grades, keys, or
  passphrases. (HMAC-blinded record keys are a possible v2 hardening.)
- **Passphrase change** rewraps the master key only; no re-encryption of ops.
  The remote compare-and-swap succeeds before the local wrapper is replaced.
- **Recovery kit**: an exportable file containing the wrapped key blob + KDF
  params + instructions. Without the passphrase or recovery kit the vault is
  permanently unrecoverable (the server cannot help; that is the point).
- Wrong passphrase and tampered blob are cryptographically indistinguishable
  (GCM auth failure) — both surface as a typed `SyncVaultUnlockError`.

Never stored anywhere: plaintext passphrase, unwrapped master key, derived
wrapping key, plaintext workspace content on the server.

## 6. Merge semantics

Three-way merge per record key: `base` (last acknowledged baseline), `local`
(current projection), `remote` (base + pulled ops).

| Local vs base | Remote vs base | Result |
|---|---|---|
| unchanged | changed | take remote |
| changed | unchanged | keep local (op stays queued) |
| changed | changed, same hash | converged; drop the queued op |
| changed | changed, different hash | **conflict** (below) |
| deleted | edited | **edit wins** — record resurrected, tombstone cleared |
| edited | deleted | edit wins — local upsert stands and pushes |
| deleted | deleted | deleted once; single tombstone |

Bootstrap-join precedence: a device with an **empty acknowledged baseline**
(joining the vault) reads every section as "changed" even when it holds
unedited boot defaults. For that device's first merge, the vault's
established **atomic and ordering** records win deterministically over the
local values (per-record collections still union), so lamport noise can never
let a joining device's empty defaults wipe vault data.

Field-aware resolution:
- Raw equality is not required. Page HTML comparison canonicalizes harmless
  browser serialization differences (attribute/class/style ordering,
  inter-tag whitespace, equivalent empty markup); tag sets and version-history
  checkpoints use semantic identity; timestamps and low-risk page metadata use
  explicit deterministic rules.
- Objects merge recursively. Id-keyed arrays merge by record id, set-like tags,
  links, references, and hashes union deterministically, and ordering documents
  use the rule above.
- Page `content`/`body` is split into validated top-level HTML blocks. Changes to
  different paragraphs/blocks merge automatically while preserving the chosen
  raw formatting. Incompatible edits to the same block are not concatenated or
  last-write-won.
- A true overlapping leaf chooses a deterministic displayed value by the
  greater `(lamport, deviceId)` operation, while one stable conflict record
  retains base, merged, local, remote, and overlapping paths for review. The
  record lives only in `sutra_sync_db`; it is never inserted into `c/pages/*`
  or `o/pages`, so it cannot flood the sidebar or recursively conflict.
- Conflict ids derive from the original record, sorted competing op ids, base
  hash, and field paths. Replay deduplicates them. A user resolution writes a
  stable `sync_conflict_resolution` entry in the encrypted `syncAuditLog`
  collection; every device then tombstones/suppresses the matching review item.
  Only the explicit **Keep both as pages** action creates a second normal page.
- Eight novel conflict ids within sixty seconds trips the `conflict-storm`
  circuit breaker before remote apply or push. Local saving and the durable
  outbox continue, but cloud sync pauses for review instead of creating a loop.
- Each unresolved alternate branch is written to the device-local conflict
  store before the selected merged value is applied or pushed. A rejected
  conflict-store transaction aborts the cycle; it is never treated as an
  advisory UI failure because doing so could discard the only retained branch.

Operation replay first honors a direct causal edge (`candidate.baseHash ==
prior.hash`). Truly concurrent operations use `(lamport, deviceId)`. Pulling a
remote operation raises the local Lamport high-water before any merged follow-up
operation is created, so a causal resolution cannot lose to its predecessor.

Tombstones: deletes are recorded locally with the deleting opId and pruned after
**90 days**. Tombstone retention prevents an offline device from resurrecting
data it never saw deleted; the delete-vs-edit rule still lets a *newer edit*
resurrect deliberately. The user-facing Trash feature is independent of
tombstones (trash entries are ordinary synced records).

Invariant: for op sets A and B, direction and replay order produce the same
canonical records and stable conflict ids. Enforced by seeded merge properties,
causal-reorder tests, and a long-running three-device engine test that asserts
quiescence after convergence.

## 7. Transport contract

```
pull({ cursor })        -> { ops: [envelope...], cursor }   // ops after cursor, ordered
push({ ops, cursor })   -> { ok: true, cursor }             // atomic append
                         | { ok: false, code: "stale-cursor" }
ping()                  -> { ok: true }
getVaultKey()           -> { wrapped } | null               // wrapped vault key blob
putVaultKey({ wrapped, expectedWrapped }) -> { ok: true }   // compare-and-swap
getSnapshot()           -> { snapshot: envelope, cursor } | null
putSnapshot({ snapshot, cursor }) -> { ok: true }
putAsset(hash, ciphertext) -> { ok: true }                  // idempotent
getAsset(hash)          -> ciphertext | null
hasAsset(hash)          -> boolean
listAssets()            -> [hash...]
listDevices() / touchDevice({ deviceId, label, cursor }) / revokeDevice(deviceId)
getDeviceStatus() / acknowledgeDeviceWipe()
deleteVault()
```

- `push` is atomic: the server checks the client's cursor equals the current
  head **for that vault**; on mismatch it returns `stale-cursor` and the client
  re-pulls, re-merges, and retries (bounded).
- Pull paging: servers may cap rows per pull; clients loop until the returned
  cursor stops advancing.
- Supabase mapping (v1 backend): RPCs `sync_pull` / `sync_push`, tables
  `sync_ops`, `sync_devices`, `sync_vault_keys`, `sync_snapshots`,
  `sync_asset_index` + private Storage bucket `sync-assets` — all isolated by
  `auth.uid()` and an active, non-revoked auth-session/device binding. Direct
  table grants are revoked; browser access is through the checked RPCs. Sync
  assets use exactly `<auth.uid()>/<lowercase-sha256>`; Storage RLS rejects
  cross-account, nested, and filename-shaped paths even when a client crafts
  one. See `supabase/sync-schema.sql` and the additive
  `supabase/migrations/20260718_sync_account_isolation.sql`.

## 8. Client storage — `sutra_sync_db` (IndexedDB, separate from the workspace DB)

| Store | Contents |
|---|---|
| `meta` | account-bound deviceId, lamport, wrapped vault key + KDF params, lastServerCursor, protocolVersion, auth session material for sync (device-local) |
| `baseline` | the last acknowledged projection (full values + hashes) tagged with its cursor — the merge base |
| `outbox` | pending ops (plaintext; encryption happens at the transport boundary), max one op per record key (coalesced) |
| `tombstones` | recordKey → { deletedAt, opId }, 90-day retention |
| `assets` | attachment upload/download state (content hash keyed) |
| `conflicts` | device-local encrypted-branch review records and resolved tombstones; never projected as pages |

None of this database is included in `.sutra` exports or any backup. Workspace
schema v6 added explicit portability containers (`schema`, `migrationHistory`,
`migrationDiagnostics`, `compatibility`, and unknown-field preservation).
Schema v7 makes `appData.assistantChatHistory` canonical. Existing legacy chat
localStorage is imported once, then becomes a canonical-to-legacy mirror; an
empty or stale mirror cannot erase synchronized history. Protocol v1 remains
compatible: schema version travels independently on every op.

Every account uses a logical namespace inside `sutra_sync_db`; an account-bound
store instance cannot enumerate or clear another account's device ID, baseline,
outbox, wrapped vault key, refresh token, asset state, or conflict records. A
non-secret local account hint is used only to select that namespace before a
refresh-token renewal. It is deleted by revoke-and-wipe and never enters a
workspace, export, or sync envelope. If an authenticated browser profile
changes accounts, the bridge stops cloud sync before any pull/push/unlock and
requires a separate profile; it preserves local data rather than merging two
cloud identities. A legacy profile that pre-dates namespaces and already has
sync enabled is also quarantined at its first post-update sign-in because the
old unscoped outbox has no trustworthy account binding. The user first creates
an encrypted local backup, then bootstraps the correct account in a fresh
profile; the bridge never guesses an owner for old operational state.

Baseline/cursor rules: the baseline advances **only** when (a) a push is
acknowledged, or (b) a pull-merge has been durably applied and verified by the
normal persistence readback. Crash between diff and ack re-diffs and re-pushes;
opId dedupe makes that safe.

## 9. Engine cycle

States: `disabled → locked → idle → syncing → idle`, plus `offline`
(exponential backoff 5s→5min with jitter and retry on `online`), `paused`,
`auth-expired`, `quota-exceeded`, `schema-mismatch`, `update-required`,
`revoked`, and `encryption-error`.

Multi-tab model: all tabs of one browser profile share one deviceId, one sync
database, and one workspace IndexedDB. Cycles are single-flight across tabs
via the `sutra-sync-cycle-v1` Web Lock (`ifAvailable`: a busy lock skips the
cycle rather than queueing). A tab whose live state is STALE — another tab
committed the workspace after its last save (the app's existing reload-toast
condition) — refuses to sync (`stale-tab` skip): pushing its outdated records
would ping-pong forever, because pulled-back ops from the shared deviceId are
treated as own echoes. The freshest-saved tab syncs; stale tabs resume after
the reload the app already prescribes. Status updates relay to every tab over
the `sutra-sync-events-v1` BroadcastChannel. Browsers without Web Locks use an
atomic expiring lease in `sutra_sync_db`; a heartbeat renews ownership and a
crashed tab's lease can be taken over. (A held leader lock was
deliberately rejected: the leader's live state goes stale the moment another
tab saves, so it would sync outdated data.)

Cycle:

1. Flush/confirm the durable local save (never apply over a mid-debounce
   keystroke), project it, diff it, and durably store the coalesced outbox
   before the first network request.
2. `pull` from lastServerCursor; decrypt + validate envelopes.
3. Raise Lamport from authenticated remote ops; run the field-aware three-way
   merge (§6), applying stable resolution markers and the conflict-storm guard.
4. If merged ≠ current: apply through the standard import path
   (`importWorkspacePayload` → migrations → normalizers → commit with readback
   verification), with echo suppression (reason `sync-remote-apply` + an
   applying-remote flag; baseline advance is the structural backstop).
5. Re-diff the merged state against the remote head → encrypt → `push`.
6. On ack: advance cursor + baseline atomically, clear acked outbox entries.

Triggers: confirmed local save (debounced), regained connectivity, tab becoming
visible, manual "Sync now", periodic foreground interval. Sync errors surface in
sync's own status UI — **never** through the local persistence-failure banner.

## 10. Snapshots & new-device bootstrap

- After N ops (default 500) or on demand, the leader uploads an encrypted
  **compaction snapshot** (full projection) tagged with its cursor. Ops at or
  below a snapshot's cursor become prunable server-side; pruning must never
  remove ops above any active device's last-seen cursor.
- New device: sign in → fetch wrapped vault key → unlock with passphrase →
  download latest snapshot → replay ops after its cursor → validate → apply →
  readback-verify → mark synced. The replay cursor comes from the snapshot
  envelope's **AAD-authenticated** `meta.cursor`, never from the transport
  response — a hostile server cannot pair an old snapshot with an inflated
  cursor to hide ops. Records arriving purely from the snapshot that the
  device holds a live tombstone for are not resurrected. If the device already has local work, the user
  chooses: use cloud here / make this device the vault's initial state / merge
  local into cloud (local state diffs against an empty baseline and pushes
  through the normal merge). A pre-sync `.sutra` safety backup is always created
  first.
- A snapshot is not reported complete while any referenced attachment is
  pending upload/download or failed integrity verification.

## 11. Auth (Supabase backend)

Sync reuses the existing Sutra Cloud email-OTP sign-in. Deliberate deviation
from the backup convention: sync persists the Supabase **refresh token** in
`sutra_sync_db.meta` (IndexedDB, this-device-only, never in workspace data or
exports) so sync survives browser restarts; backups keep their
sessionStorage-only sessions. Every sync RPC binds the authenticated Supabase
`session_id` claim to one registered device row. Revoking that row blocks RPC
and `sync-assets` Storage access on the next request; direct table grants are
revoked so a device cannot bypass the check with PostgREST.

Every browser RPC derives ownership from `auth.uid()` and validates the caller
device against that user; no sync RPC accepts a `userId`/`user_id` ownership
argument. Direct PostgREST access to sync tables is denied even to the owning
authenticated user so device/session revocation cannot be bypassed. The public
browser transport strips accidental ownership hints before issuing an RPC; this
is defense in depth, not the authorization boundary. Real Account A/B REST,
RPC, Storage, and ciphertext inspection remains an operator-run gate described
in [`SUPABASE_ACCOUNT_ISOLATION_CHECKLIST.md`](../release/SUPABASE_ACCOUNT_ISOLATION_CHECKLIST.md).

### 11.1 Revoke and wipe

Ordinary sign-out and device revocation have different semantics. Sign-out
clears the Supabase session and in-memory vault material, pauses sync, and keeps
the local workspace. `sync_revoke_device` immediately sets `revoked_at`,
`revoked_by`, and `wipe_required`; every data/key/snapshot/asset path remains
denied through the existing active-device authorization.

A denied pull is not a wipe command. The target separately calls
`sync_get_device_status`; only the exact authenticated user + JWT `session_id` +
registered `deviceId` receives the bounded `sutra-device-status-v1` response.
The client additionally binds it to the configured Supabase project and accepts
only `DEVICE_REVOKED` with `wipeRequired: true`. HTTP 401/403, token refresh
failure, offline/DNS/timeout/CSP errors, malformed JSON, other origins, and
generic `revoked` errors remain locked/non-destructive.

After verification, all tabs block writes, cancel pending saves, clear vault
material, close IndexedDB handles, and coordinate over
`sutra-sync-events-v1`. The canonical wipe deletes this origin's local/session
storage plus `noteflow_atelier_db`, `noteflow_attachments_db`, `sutra_sync_db`,
`sutra-drive-sync-keys`, `sutra-fs-config`, and `sutra_share_target_db`, verifies
deletion, then calls `sync_acknowledge_device_wipe` and clears the remaining auth
session. Failure stays locked and unacknowledged. Offline/powered-off browsers
cannot be erased until they reconnect; service-worker app caches, downloaded
`.sutra` files, external backup-folder contents, and unrelated origins are not
deleted.

The principal browser workflow was manually verified against the configured
Supabase project on 2026-07-18: a controller revoked a second device, the target
kept its local data while offline, then wiped on its next verified connection;
reload did not resurrect the workspace and reuse required fresh authentication
and registration. Automated fail-closed, multi-tab, and hostile-account tests
remain required release evidence.
