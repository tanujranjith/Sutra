# Customizable Home dashboard

Home composes existing canonical workspace cards; it does not copy task,
calendar, review, homework, habit, or backup data into a separate dashboard
store. `src/features/workspace/today-dashboard.js` owns only presentation
preferences and reorders the existing DOM nodes after their normal renderers run.

The durable preference lives at `settings.preferences.today.dashboard` and is
therefore included in ordinary workspace persistence, encrypted `.sutra`
backups, restore, and the existing atomic Settings Sync record. Its bounded
contract is:

- `version`: preference schema version.
- `preset`: `calm`, `study`, `everything`, or `custom`.
- `order`: every known widget ID exactly once after normalization.
- `hidden`: a deduplicated allowlist of hidden widget IDs.
- `sizes`: a bounded width choice per widget.

The calm preset keeps only the daily loop's Next up, Upcoming Radar, Priorities,
and save-confidence surfaces visible on desktop. Duplicate deadline and schedule
snapshots, secondary signals, and advanced planners remain available through the
Study and Everything presets or Home customization; they are not deleted. An
older saved Calm snapshot migrates to the current essentials-only composition,
while custom layouts retain their explicit choices. Desktop users can customize
from the Home toolbar or More actions menu. The dedicated phone Home shell
remains the canonical compact mobile experience and is not rearranged by desktop
widget preferences.

Reordering uses visible buttons in addition to pointer controls, presets are
real buttons with pressed state, and the modal delegates focus containment,
Escape handling, scroll locking, and focus restoration to `SutraModalManager`.
