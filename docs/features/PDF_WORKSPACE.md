# Sutra Native PDF Workspace

## Contract

The PDF workspace is a contextual surface, not a top-level Files section. A PDF is stored once in the existing `courseWorkspace.files` metadata store and `noteflow_attachments_db` byte store, then linked to courses, notes, homework, assignments, private documents, or PDF page sources through `attachmentLinks`.

The feature is default-on and gated by `settings.preferences.workspace.pdfWorkspaceEnabled`. When a user disables it or when the native runtime cannot start, Sutra retains its safe browser preview and download path.

## Local runtime

- PDF.js 6.1.200 is vendored under `assets/vendor/pdfjs` and handles rendering, text extraction, outlines, search, forms, and metadata.
- pdf-lib 1.17.1 is vendored under `assets/vendor/pdf-lib` and handles assembly and generated exports.
- A local Liberation Sans font and PDF.js character maps/standard fonts are included. The feature makes no runtime CDN request.
- Served Chromium and WebKit pages use the vendored PDF.js worker. Direct `file://` use and Firefox use the tested same-thread vendored runtime because the worker path is not reliable for the current form fixture there; browser preview remains the final fallback.
- Embedded PDF JavaScript is never evaluated. External links are not opened automatically.

## Data ownership

`pdfDocuments` stores page plans, stable page IDs, rotations, bookmarks, and bounded durable checkpoints. `pdfAnnotations` stores independent stable records with normalized coordinates in the unrotated page coordinate system. Form values are annotation records with `type: "form"` and a `fieldKey`.

Zoom, selection, scroll position, open panels, and undo/redo stacks are session-only. The original attachment bytes are immutable. Removing a PDF from one context removes only that link. Byte removal is allowed only when no attachment link or PDF page source still refers to the file.

Capture/Notes insert linked PDF cards and keep **Convert to Note** explicit.
Courses, Homework, Assignment Studio, private documents, and the PWA Share
Target all route bytes and links through the same attachment bridge. Homework
and Assignment Studio provide contextual upload actions; an Assignment Studio
file can also be linked to its Homework record without duplicating bytes.

## Editing boundary

V1 supports highlights, underline, strikeout, ink, erasing, text boxes, comments, stamps, visual signatures, bookmarks, form values, page reorder/rotation/removal, splitting/merging plans, and PDF/image assembly. Visual signatures are ink; they are not cryptographic signatures. Existing page text cannot be arbitrarily replaced, and scanned PDFs are not searchable without future OCR.

## Export

The export dialog always distinguishes:

1. Exact original bytes.
2. Current page arrangement without visual annotations.
3. Current page arrangement with flattened visual annotations.

Form answers have separate include and flatten choices. Comments become numbered page markers and may include an appended summary. Every generated export is reopened with PDF.js before download. Exact-original output is compared byte-for-byte with its stored source.

Encrypted PDFs may be opened after a memory-only password prompt when PDF.js can decrypt them. Edited export remains disabled because pdf-lib cannot safely modify encrypted sources. A source digital signature is preserved only by exact-original export; modified-copy export displays a signature-validity warning.

## Public bridges

- `window.SutraAttachments.addFiles/readBytes/readDataUrl/link/unlink/listForEntity/list/get/download/remove/validate`
- `window.SutraPdfWorkspace.open/createFromFiles/export/getContext/close/isEnabled`
- `window.SutraPdfAdapter.load/extractText`
- Internal durable seam: `window.SutraPdfData`

The runtime emits `sutra:attachment-added`, `sutra:attachment-links-changed`, and `sutra:pdf-saved`.
