# Canvas And Timed Habits

This note documents the June 2026 Sutra hardening pass for first-class Canvas
pages and timed daily commitments.

## Canvas Architecture

Canvas pages are normal Notes-tree pages with `type: "canvas"`. They keep their
state in the existing page record:

```json
{
  "id": "page_id",
  "title": "Essay Brainstorm",
  "type": "canvas",
  "spaceId": "space_id",
  "canvas": {
    "version": 1,
    "viewport": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "zoom": 1 },
    "background": "grid",
    "snapToGrid": true,
    "gridVisible": true,
    "objects": [],
    "connections": [],
    "groups": []
  }
}
```

Objects, connections, groups, pinned-page references, linked Sutra note cards,
and Assistant context all use stable IDs. Canvas state is normalized during page
hydration and travels through local persistence plus `.sutra` export/restore
because it lives in `appData.pages`.

The renderer is a local structured DOM/SVG layer rather than a bundled canvas
SDK. That keeps Sutra static-file compatible, avoids remote dependencies, and
lets the app reuse existing page, space, pinning, search, export, restore, theme,
Assistant, and modal systems.

Adopted patterns:

- Open spatial workspace with pan, zoom, zoom reset, and viewport persistence.
- Compact tool strip for selection, pan, pen, text, sticky notes, shapes,
  connectors, tables, linked Sutra notes, undo, redo, and zoom controls.
- Structured objects with stable IDs, explicit geometry, and separate connector
  records.
- Link cards for existing Sutra content rather than duplicating note bodies.
- Bounded Assistant context that includes visible text/card metadata without
  dumping unlimited Canvas content.
- Local JSON-style persistence with migration-safe defaults.
- Local export controls for PNG, a practical single-page PDF rendition, and a
  Sutra-specific JSON model export.

Excluded for this pass:

- Real-time collaboration, presence, share links, and remote embeds.
- Heavy SDK bundling or remote CDN loading.
- Full JSON Canvas import/export parity.
- Advanced plugin-level object schemas, custom shape SDKs, and server-backed
  asset stores.

Those exclusions fit Sutra's local-first static architecture and avoid adding
opaque dependencies or network requirements.

## Timed Daily Commitments

Timed commitments extend the existing habit tracker with `type: "timed"` and
fields for target duration, schedule, reminder times, completion history, and
streak evaluation. Starting a timer never completes the habit. The user must
confirm completion for the local calendar date; duplicate confirmations are
blocked, future dates are rejected by the local-date gate, unscheduled days are
ignored, and missed scheduled days reset the streak once.

Timed reminders are derived through the existing notification center as
`source: "timedHabit"` notifications and respect read/dismissed state.
