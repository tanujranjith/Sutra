# Sutra Intelligence & Sutra Assistant

Sutra Intelligence is the local-first "thinking" layer inside Sutra. Sutra
Assistant is the chat surface you talk to. Together they form a maintainable
intelligence system built from small registries, schemas, adapters, and a local
router — not one giant prompt or one monolithic file.

This document explains what runs locally, when (and only when) a provider is
called, how Local Help works without an API key, what the assistant can do, how
action proposals / confirmation / Activity / Undo work, what Assistant Memory is
and how to manage it, and exactly what a `.sutra` export includes and excludes.

## 1. Architecture — the Sutra Intelligence Harness

| Concern | Module / owner | Global |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product knowledge (verified facts) | `src/features/assistant/sutra-product-knowledge.js` | `window.SutraProductKnowledge` |
| Certified-action metadata (domain, scope, flags) | `src/features/assistant/sutra-capability-registry.js` | `window.SutraCapabilityRegistry` |
| Local signals + Activity log + import parsing | `src/features/assistant/flow-intelligence.js` | `window.sutraIntelligence` / `window.flowIntelligence` |
| Action catalog, validate / preview / apply / undo, intent router | `src/features/assistant/flow-assistant.js` | `window.sutraAssistant` / `window.flowAssistant`, `window.SutraAssistantActions` |
| Long-term memory store + retrieval + manager UI | `src/features/assistant/sutra-assistant-memory.js` | `window.SutraAssistantMemory` |
| Local Help decision tree + UI | `src/features/assistant/sutra-local-help.js` | `window.SutraLocalHelp` |
| Local Help / Memory styling | `styles/features/sutra-assistant-help.css` | — |

The registry-style modules load **before** `flow-assistant.js`; the memory and
Local Help modules load **after** it (they call its one action pipeline at
runtime). Legacy `flow*` globals are preserved as aliases.

**Why this shape:** adding a feature = one structured registry entry, not edits
scattered across prompts. Parsing, validation, preview, execution, logging, and
undo are independently testable (`scripts/sutra-intelligence-harness-check.mjs`,
`tests/e2e/assistant-intelligence-upgrade.spec.mjs`).

---

## 2. What runs locally vs. what calls a provider

**Sutra Intelligence makes no server calls itself.** These always work offline,
with **no API key**:

- Product/help answers (Product Knowledge Registry).
- Local Help decision-tree flows.
- Navigation and supported direct commands.
- Deterministic workspace summaries: overdue, due-today, schedule conflicts,
  review debt, grade math, daily briefing, recovery plans.
- Assistant Memory (create, retrieve, edit, disable, delete) and the Memory
  manager.

A request only goes to the **AI provider you configured** when it genuinely
needs generation — drafting, explaining, transforming, extracting, or open-ended
planning reasoning that local systems can't do.

The Local Intent Router (in `flow-assistant.js`) decides this **before** any
provider call. Locally-answered results are clearly labeled — Local Help cards
show an **"Answered locally / No API key required"** badge, memory recalls are
tagged as coming from saved memory, and proposals render as confirmation cards.

---

## 3. Local Help (no API key required)

Local Help is a click-through, multiple-choice help mode for non-generative
features. It works when no provider is selected, no key is entered, or you are
offline.

- Open it from the assistant empty state ("Browse Local Help" / "Open Local
  Help"), or type `help` / `local help`.
- Pick an option → Sutra shows a local answer card (pulled from the verified
  Product Knowledge registry), optional numbered steps, follow-up choices, an
  **"Open in Sutra"** button for navigation, **Back** / **Help menu** /
  **Never mind** controls, and — only where a generative follow-up could help —
  a **"Use provider instead"** option that fires *only* if you choose it.
- It never calls a provider on its own, adds no analytics/telemetry, and does
  not create long-term memory.

Each help topic is one data entry in `sutra-local-help.js`, usually referencing a
Product Knowledge id so help text and product facts stay in lockstep.

**Guided Local Mode — workspace task paths.** Beyond how-to help, the Local Help
root menu leads with task paths about *your own* workspace, answered by Sutra's
deterministic local engines and certified read-only / navigation actions — no API
key required: **What should I do next?**, **Show what is due**, **Handle overdue
work**, **Check grade risk**, and **Plan my day**. Each explains what Sutra does
locally, links straight into the relevant view (All Due, Timeline, Grade Planner)
via a certified action, and never dead-ends. Grade risk stays fully local (grade
math is deterministic). Where a task genuinely needs generation — a full recovery
plan, a timed day plan — the local path stops at a reusable **"this step needs
generative AI"** gate that offers *Connect a provider* / *Show what Sutra does
locally* / *Back to the guided menu*, so a no-key student always gets a clear fork
instead of a dead end or a silent provider call. Paths include next step, what's
due, overdue, grade risk, plan my day, prepare for an exam, break down an
assignment, build a study plan, organize notes, and run a weekly review. These
paths, their reachability from the root menu, no-dead-end guarantee, and their
certified-action references are locked by the Intelligence Harness
(`scripts/sutra-intelligence-harness-check.mjs`).

---

## 4. Workspace Access (context depth)

Workspace Access controls how much of your workspace the assistant can read when
you send an AI request:

- **Minimal** — almost nothing beyond your message.
- **Current view** — only the active screen / current area.
- **Full workspace** — broad context across your workspace.

Locked-note contents and API keys are **never** included at any setting. Each
certified action also declares a required scope in the Capability Registry, so
the registry knows which actions a given depth permits. Change it in
**Settings ▸ Assistant** or by asking the assistant to change context depth.

---

## 5. What Sutra Assistant can do — certified actions

Actions are defined once in the action catalog (`flow-assistant.js`) and enriched
with declarative metadata (domain owner, required scope, read-only / reversible /
destructive flags) in the Capability Registry. Covered domains: navigation;
planner tasks; Homework; notes & pages; Canvas; Course Hub; Timeline; Review &
flashcards; Cram/AP study; plans (day/week/study/exam/recovery/triage); Grade
Planner (read-only, deterministic local math); College; focus & utilities;
themes (via the dedicated theme pipeline); and Assistant Memory.

**Action protocol:** providers may only propose certified action types. The
registry — not the model — is authoritative. Proposals render as Apply / Decline
**preview cards**; previews never mutate state. High-risk and destructive actions
(e.g. deleting a timeline block, forgetting a memory) always require explicit
confirmation. Unknown action types or invalid values fail safely before an Apply
button appears, and ambiguous targets trigger a clarifying question.

**Activity & Undo:** every applied action is written to the local Activity log
and most actions support Undo ("undo that", or the Undo button in the Activity
log). Undo restores prior state where technically safe.

---

## 6. Assistant Memory

Assistant Memory is persistent, local, user-controlled long-term memory,
separate from conversation context. Saved visible chats may persist locally;
the Single Request / Conversation Memory setting controls whether prior turns
are sent with the next provider request.

### What it remembers

Stable, useful facts you ask it to keep: study hours, planning style, recurring
commitments, course preferences, academic goals, upcoming exams, preferred
explanation level, assistant-behavior preferences, project context.

Categories: `profile_preferences`, `study_preferences`, `schedule_constraints`,
`academic_goals`, `course_context`, `recurring_commitments`,
`assistant_preferences`, `project_context`, `user_notes`, `temporary_context`.

### What it will NEVER store

Passwords, API keys, authentication/credentials, financial data, medical data,
precise location, locked-note content, private note content, full chat
transcripts, provider responses, or security configuration. A deterministic
sensitivity classifier **blocks** such content at write time, so it can never be
saved (and therefore never exported).

### Consent & control

- Saved only on explicit request ("remember that …") or when you accept a
  suggestion (Save / Edit / Decline).
- View, search, edit, enable/disable, delete, and **forget** any memory in the
  Memory manager (**Settings ▸ Assistant ▸ Manage Memory**). "Forget X" and
  "delete that memory" take effect immediately; deleted/disabled memories stop
  being retrieved at once. Batch deletes confirm first.
- Turn **"Use saved memory"** off to ignore memory without deleting it.
- Memory actions (`create_memory`, `update_memory`, `enable_memory`,
  `disable_memory`, `delete_memory`, `clear_expired_memories`,
  `clear_temporary_memories`, `open_memory_manager`) flow through the same
  validate → preview → confirm → apply → Activity → Undo pipeline as every other
  action.

### Retrieval

Deterministic and explainable — keyword + category + linked-object + recency +
confidence ranking, each surfaced as a plain reason ("matches 'exam', relevant
Course context, updated recently, high confidence"). No embeddings, no cloud, no
telemetry. Only a small, relevant set of **enabled, non-expired** memories is
retrieved; expired, disabled, and deleted records are excluded. When a provider
request is made, only those compact snippets are attached (never a dump of
everything), and the records used are recorded.

### Deduplication & merge

An exact restatement of an existing memory is kept up to date in place (never
duplicated). A **near-duplicate** — highly similar but not identical, in the same
category — is still saved, but the result carries a **merge suggestion** so you
can fold the two together instead of silently accumulating overlapping notes.
`mergeMemories` combines two records' detail lines and links, keeps the higher
confidence, records provenance in `mergedFrom`, and is fully reversible via Undo.
All merge metadata rides inside the existing `sutra:assistantMemory:v1` store and
round-trips through export/import with no secrets.

---

## 7. `.sutra` export / import — a complete workspace backup

A `.sutra` export is a **full workspace backup**, not just notes. Export/import
coverage is tracked in `docs/architecture/persistence-inventory.json` and
enforced by `scripts/round-trip-check.mjs` and `scripts/sutra-guardrails-check.mjs`.

**Included** (every persistent, non-secret store), among others: notes/pages,
folders/spaces, tags, templates, Canvas, locked-note metadata; planner tasks +
order; Homework; Course Hub (courses, assignments, linked notes/resources,
dashboards, archives); Timeline blocks; Review decks + spaced-repetition state;
AP Study; Assignment Studio; Grade Planner; Semester Setup; School Schedule;
College / Life / Business; themes + custom themes; UI preferences and settings;
onboarding state; pinned pages; notifications state; the Assistant **Activity
log**; and **Assistant Memory** (`sutra:assistantMemory:v1`, which rides along in
the localStorage snapshot). Durable conversations themselves are canonical in
`appData.assistantChatHistory`; the old localStorage chat keys are one-time
migration/compatibility mirrors. When **Save chat history** is enabled, encrypted
`.sutra` backups include the sanitized durable conversation store; plaintext
JSON includes it only with the separate explicit plaintext-recovery opt-in.
Encrypted Sutra Sync always includes that durable store and its conversation/
message order, citations, grounding, memory references, and durable receipts,
independent of the plaintext JSON preference.

**Never exported** (deliberate security exclusions): AI provider **API keys**,
access/refresh tokens, client secrets, passwords, `.sutra` passphrases, derived
encryption keys, Google Drive device-local sync metadata, in-flight/streaming
chat buffers, abort/request state, typing indicators, token/latency diagnostics,
in-session unlocked-page state, and regenerable caches. API keys are session-only
and never appear in `.sutra`, JSON, Sutra Sync, Activity logs, Memory,
diagnostics, prompts, or cloud snapshots.

**Import** restores into the correct authoritative store, migrates older exports,
tolerates missing or newer sections, validates before writing, avoids partial
overwrites on failure, and avoids duplicating mirrored data (e.g. planner-task ↔
Homework mirrors). Old workspaces with no memory store import cleanly.

**Encrypted backups:** an encrypted `.sutra` is AES-256-GCM with a PBKDF2-derived
key from your passphrase. Optional cloud backup (Google Drive / OneDrive /
Dropbox / Supabase) is consent-first and encrypts on-device before upload.

Where: **Settings ▸ Backups & Export** → Export (optionally encrypted) / Import.

## 8. Provider compatibility & instructions

Supported providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, xAI,
Perplexity, and OpenAI-compatible local endpoints (Ollama, LM Studio, …). For
provider-bound requests the system prompt is built dynamically from the
registries — relevant product knowledge, relevant certified action schemas, the
allowed workspace context, and the small set of retrieved memories — and instructs
the model to: never invent Sutra features/screens/settings/actions/memories;
never claim a feature not present in provided product knowledge; never write
memory except via a `create_memory` proposal; never infer sensitive memories from
chat; ask for clarification when ambiguous; and use Sutra's deterministic local
systems for grade math and schedule-conflict detection.

DeepSeek, xAI, and Perplexity are real, direct browser integrations using the
same audited OpenAI-compatible request builder as their compatible peers. They
are **text-first** in Sutra: model-specific native image input is enabled only
when `SutraModelCapabilities` recognizes it, while native PDF, document, audio,
and video input is not claimed for those adapters. Sutra does not send an
explicit reasoning-effort parameter to those providers; provider defaults apply.
Unknown provider IDs are treated as text-only by the capability registry rather
than inheriting attachment support from a similarly named model.

**Verification freshness.** Sutra only claims capabilities its in-repo adapter
actually implements, and each claim is dated in
`model-capabilities.js → CAPABILITY_VERIFICATION`. A static check
(`scripts/sutra-capability-freshness-check.mjs`, part of `check:all`) warns when a
record is over 9 months old and fails past 15 months, so stale provider-API
assumptions surface deliberately instead of silently misclassifying new models.
The Intelligence Harness additionally asserts every reasoning provider carries a
dated record.

---

## 9. Provider-request trust pipeline

Every provider request is assembled locally through one deterministic pipeline:
rank explicit targets and current context, exclude locked/expired/disabled/private
records, enforce a provider/model budget, fence untrusted material, then perform a
last-mile scope and privacy audit. The audit sees no key or authorization header.
It blocks secrets, locked-content markers, unsafe URL schemes, and categories
outside the chosen Workspace Access level before fetch construction.

Each response carries a versioned provenance receipt that explains local versus
provider handling, inspected areas, live-validated sources, memory influence by
safe count, attachment processing paths, deterministic engines, proposed certified
actions, context reduction, and transmitted categories. Interrupted, cancelled,
partial, stale-source, action, and error states use the same receipt contract.
Provider reasoning and raw system/context prompts are never displayed or saved.

Streaming is enabled only for provider/model adapters whose implemented
capabilities say so. Stop uses an isolated AbortController, preserves and labels
partial text, and never parses incomplete action JSON. Retry reuses the existing
user turn and action idempotency keys. Structured output is validated only after a
complete response. Errors distinguish authentication, rate limits, overload,
timeouts, network/CSP, unavailable models/endpoints, malformed/empty responses,
attachment problems, cancellation/partial output, stale sources,
action/storage/Undo failures, and partial batches.

## 10. Privacy & security invariants

- Sutra Intelligence is local-first and makes no server calls itself.
- Product Knowledge, Local Help, Memory, and deterministic intelligence work
  fully offline.
- API keys are session-only. Credentials never enter Memory,
  exports, Activity logs, prompts, diagnostics, or UI text.
- Locked-note contents are never read by the assistant.
- No analytics, tracking, telemetry, or Sutra backend.
- CSP, DOM safety (`SutraDOMSafety`), safe storage (`SutraSafeStorage`),
  encryption, export/import safeguards, and architecture guardrails are
  preserved — the new modules add zero raw DOM/storage sinks.

---

## 11. Limitations & intentionally unsupported behaviors

- The assistant has **no task-delete action** by design; complete/archive
  instead. Timeline-block deletion exists but requires explicit user intent and
  a destructive confirmation.
- Homework assignments cannot be archived (complete or reschedule them).
- Grade math, GPA, and required-score calculations are always local — the model
  never computes them.
- Memory never stores secrets/credentials/financial/medical/precise-location or
  locked/private content, and never saves full chat transcripts or provider
  responses. Vague requests cannot trigger bulk deletion, provider/security
  changes, backup/export, cloud sync, or mass overwrite.
- The assistant never runs arbitrary JavaScript/HTML or model-generated code, and
  never uses `eval`.
